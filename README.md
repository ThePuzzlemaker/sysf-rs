# System F in Rust

This is an implementation of [Dunfield and Krishnaswami's "Complete and Easy Bidirectional Typechecking for Higher-Rank Polymorphism"](https://research.cs.queensu.ca/home/jana/papers/bidir/) in Rust.

Very WIP at the moment.

## TODOs

- [ ] Clean up code
- [ ] Proper testing
- [ ] Proper REPL and CLI
- [ ] Language-level fixpoint and conditional, maybe sum types/product types or isorecursive types, and/or other extensions
- [ ] Evaluator
- [ ] Actually use files and stuff
- [ ] Definitions
- [ ] Maybe add simple module includes?
- [ ] Maybe add type/term arenas?
- [ ] Better error handling

## Syntax

```ebnf
(* =:= Basic definitions =:= *)
alpha_upper = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" | "I" | "J" | "K"
            | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U" | "V"
            | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z" ;
alpha_lower = "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" | "j" | "k"
            | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u" | "v"
            | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z" ;
alpha       = alpha_upper | alpha_lower ;
digit       = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;

(* Whitespace is ignored. *)
whitespace = "\r" | "\n" | "\r\n" | " " | "\t" ;

(* =:= Identifiers =:= *)

ident_start    = alpha ;
ident_continue = ident_begin | digit | "_" ;

ident = ident_begin, [ ident_cont ] ;
tyvar = "'", ident ;

(* =:= Types =:= *)

type = "unit" | "bool"   (* Primitives               *)
     | tyvar, "=>", type (* Universal quantification *)
     | type, "->", type  (* Arrow                    *)
     | tyvar             (* Type variable            *)
     | "(", type, ")"    (* Grouping                 *)

(* =:= Terms =:= *)

term = "true" | "false"       (* Booleans           *)
     | "()"                   (* Unit               *)
     | "\\", ident, ".", term (* Lambda-abstraction *)
     | term, term             (* Application        *)
     | term, "[", type, "]"   (* Type application   *)
     | term, ":", type        (* Annotation         *)
     | ident                  (* Variable           *)
     | "(", term, ")"         (* Grouping           *)
```

Types of the form `'__exstX` (where X is some number) may be generated by typechecking--they are existential variables that may be generated during typechecking and inference. You can think of them as somewhat similar to `'_weakX` in OCaml. Note that these generally indicate that a type could not be checked without more information. If you can't seem to get rid of them, it's possible you can't express what you are trying to in the language.

See [`src/grammar.lalrpop`](src/grammar.lalrpop) for the exact grammar used by the parser.

## Overall Process

1. Parse input.
2. Lower surface AST to core AST (i.e. convert named variables to De Bruijn indices)
3. Run typechecking! (WIP)
4. Evaluate (WIP)

## Debugging

This project uses the [`tracing`](https://lib.rs/tracing) crate, so you can use the `RUST_LOG` flag to control what tracing information is printed. This is currently only in the typechecker, but will be extended further at some point. Tracing can be disabled at compile-time (which will not compile any tracing infrastructure at all) by disabling the `trace` feature.

You can set the debugging mode by commenting out/uncommenting one of the lines at the start of `fn main()` in [`src/main.rs`](src/main.rs), though this will be moved to a runtime method at some point in the future.
